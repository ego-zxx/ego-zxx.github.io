    <p>I met you in a ML and from the very start, your personality felt so warm, so full of fun, and it just clicked with me in a way I didn’t expect. I loved how you matched my energy so effortlessly like when I'd be spamming in caps like a mad man you'd speak in caps too i, how every moment felt alive when you were there. I found myself sending you more and more reels, little pieces of me reaching out to you, and somewhere along the way—without even realizing it—I started to fall for you.</p>

      <p>HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII MY LOVE < 3 Welcome to this little corner of the internet, a space I built with heart and intention. This isn’t just another website, it’s a reflection of stories, ideas, and moments that matter to me and maybe, if you linger here a little while, something that matters to you too. I believe every person carries their own journey, full of quiet struggles and hidden triumphs, and this space is about embracing those pieces with honesty and openness. As you explore, I hope you find not just information but also a spark of connection, a reminder that you’re not alone in your questions, your dreams, or your search for meaning. The future is uncertain, but that’s what makes it exciting each step is a chance to grow, to discover, and to create. And while I can’t promise where the road will lead, I can promise that this space will always be a place for authenticity, growth, and possibility. So take your time, wander through, and maybe let this journey become a part of yours. </p>

<section id="apology-section" class="section"> <h2>Apology</h2> <p>Dear Sneha,</p> <p>I hope this finds you well,</p> <p>
I know I hurt you with what I said, and no excuse can change that. I kept telling myself it was just me being dramatic, but that doesn’t matter what matters is how my words made you feel. I should never have said something like that, especially to you, the person I cherish the most. You didn’t deserve to be hurt, and I regret that I was careless with my words. I promise I’ll be more mindful, more gentle, because you mean too much to me to ever risk wounding you again. I’m sorry, deeply and truly. I respect the space you need, and I'm here whenever you're ready to talk.
</p>
<p> With all my love,</p>
<p> Your dumb rat.</p>

 <section id="letter-section" class="section"> <h2 id="letter-title">Letter to You</h2> <h3></h3> <h4>I love you so much </h4> <p>My Love,</p> <p>My love, I know I can be dramatic at times, and sometimes I say things without realizing how they land. But when it comes to you, every word I choose matters, because you’re the one who matters most to me. I don’t want my slip ups to ever make your question or shadow the love I have for you.</p> <p>You bring so much light into my life, and I want you to always feel that from me. I’ll be more thoughtful with my words, not out of pressure, but because I want you to feel safe and cherished with me.</p> <p>Your presence in my life is like a gentle breeze, comforting. Through the highs and lows, your unwavering support has always stayed with me, grounding me in the warmth of our shared love.</p> <p>I don’t know exactly what the future holds, but I know what I want: to walk into it with you, hand in hand, facing whatever comes our way. Because truthfully, there’s nowhere else I’d rather be than right beside you.</p> <p>Thank you for being my friend, my partner, my best friend, my lover, my girlfriend and my greatest source of joy. With each passing day, my love for you deepens and grows then I could ever describe, and I look forward to the countless moments we have yet to create together.</p> <p>Forever yours,</p> <p>Your Love</p> </section>
